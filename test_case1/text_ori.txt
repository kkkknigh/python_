We report a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study on the stability, geometric structure,
electronic characteristics, and catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on low-index
Ni3P crystal surfaces, namely, the (001), (100), (110), (101) and (111) planes with diﬀerent surface
terminations. The results indicate that P-rich and some stoichiometric surfaces are thermodynamically
stable. Eight stable surfaces were selected to investigate the electronic characteristics and catalytic
activity. The (110)B facet of Ni3P is indispensable for the HER, because it not only displays improved
electrocatalytic activity, but also possesses suitable potential and high stability. Increasing the active sites
through doping or enlarging the surface area could be a useful strategy to improve the HER activity
further. Furthermore, it was found that Ni3P requires higher energies for decomposition in the absence
of O2, although it is thermodynamically unstable in aqueous solutions with most pH values and
potentials. This study provides important insights into the surface properties of Ni3P for water splitting
and opens up an exciting opportunity to optimize the performance of solar energy conversion devices
by synthesizing preferentially exposed catalyst facets.
Introduction
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by using electro-
chemical water splitting has long been considered as an
important technology without any environmental pollution.1
Among the cathode materials for water splitting, including
transition metals and their dichalcogenides,25 carbides,6,7
borides,8 and nitrides,9 phosphides have attracted considerable
attention in the eld of electrochemical catalysis due to their
many advantages such as earth-abundance, high catalytic
activity, good stability and facile synthesis.10,11 Nickel phosphide
(NixPy) is one of the most promising candidates among transi-
tion metal phosphides. In these types of compounds, phos-
phorus has a lower catenation tendency and exhibits a wide
variety of building blocks (cages, dumbbells, etc.) and super-
structures (1D to 3D chains). Furthermore, NixPy oen forms
amorphous lms which are immune to chemical attack at grain
boundaries, and therefore they generally possess high corrosion
resistance in acidic solutions and can only be dissolved in hot
oxidising acids such as HNO3.12 Nickel phosphides have been
reported in more than ten stoichiometric compositions,1316
among which Ni12P5, Ni2P, Ni5P4, and NiP2 have attracted much
attention for their synthesis, structure, and reactivity.1719
Ni3P, as the most Ni rich phosphide, has been mostly re-
ported for its roles at the solder joint interface formed by
reaction-induced crystallization. It has been reported that Ni3P
can also be synthesized using electrochemical deposition,20,21
solid state reactions22 and hydrothermal reactions.23,24 However,
a few Ni rich phosphides are reported as the electro-cathode
materials for hydrogen evolution.25 Recently, Jin et al. re-
ported the HER properties of trinickel monophosphide (Ni3P)
porous hollow nanospheres, which showed eﬃcient catalytic
performance. The overpotential required to reach a current
density of 20 mA cm2 is as small as 99 mV in an acidic solu-
tion.26 Pan et al. investigated the electrocatalytic properties for
the HER of diﬀerent types of nickel phosphides (Ni12P5, Ni2P
and Ni5P4) and found that the catalytic properties followed the
order of Ni5P4 > Ni2P > Ni12P5, and their potentials at a current
density of 10 mA cm2 are 118, 137 and 208 mV, respectively.18 It
was suggested that the Ni-rich phosphide has a relatively poor
HER activity. However, Ni3P, as the most Ni rich phosphide, was
found to be more active in the experiment.26 The diﬀerence
among the few existing reports indicates that it is crucial to
obtain a comprehensive understanding of Ni3P for its roles in
the HER. Recently, in situ experimental results of most catalysts
show that facet orientations play crucial roles on catalytic
activity.2732 These results show that facet orientation is an
important consideration for the design and fabrication of
highly eﬃcient catalysts. However, among the theoretical

 studies, most researchers only paid attention to the stoichio-
metric surface to understand the surface properties and reac-
tion mechanism.33 The non-stoichiometric surface could be
more stable in most cases, and could truly represent the
reality.34 Therefore, attention should also be paid to non-
stoichiometric surfaces during theoretical studies.
In this work, we report a comprehensive theoretical study of
Ni3P, including its geometric structure, electronic characteris-
tics, HER activity and stability for diﬀerent surface orientations
and terminations using density functional theory (DFT) calcu-
lations. Our current study provides an improved understanding
of this material and insights into its electro-catalytic ability for
the HER. The outcome also helps in the design and selection of
electrocatalysts in the experiment.
Results and discussion
Surface energies for diﬀerent ordinations and terminations
Surface energy is an important parameter that aﬀects the
stability and catalytic activity. Fig. 1 shows the surface energies
of stable surfaces with diﬀerent terminations.
At rst, the allowed ranges of chemical potentials (DmP, DmNi)
were determined from the formation energy of diﬀerent struc-
tures. The results of Fig. 1(a) are consistent with previous
experiments and calculations.3537 We nd that Ni3P is stable at
1.78 eV< DmP < 1.18 eV. When DmP is smaller than 1.78 eV,
bulk Ni becomes thermodynamically favorable, while Ni12P5
becomes favorable when DmP is larger than 1.18 eV. Consid-
ering the temperature eﬀect and interface reorganization
contributions, the DmP was enlarged from 1.88 eV to 1.08 eV
during the surface energy calculation. Fig. 1(b) demonstrates
the stable terminations for diﬀerent low-index surfaces. It
indicates that Ni-rich surfaces are not stable in all low-index
surfaces as there is no line with a slope greater than zero. For
the (001) and (011) surfaces, the P-rich surfaces are stable in the
whole region of DmP. For the (110) and (111) surfaces, the P-rich
surfaces are stable in a large region especially in the P-rich
environment (DmP around 1.18 eV), while stoichiometric
surfaces become stable in the Ni-rich environment (DmP around
1.78 eV). For the (100) surface, stoichiometric surfaces are
stable in a large region. Furthermore, the (110) surface has the
lowest surface energy. Based on the surface energies, the above
eight surfaces with the lowest energies were selected to inves-
tigate the electronic characteristics and catalytic activity.
Geometric structure of stable surfaces
The optimized geometric structures of eight stable surfaces are
shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2 displays the top and side views of stable surfaces with
diﬀerent terminations. Among these surfaces, the (100)B, (110)
C and (111)D are the stoichiometric surfaces while others are P-
rich surfaces. In all surfaces, the surface Ni and P atoms are
coplanar in a relaxed slab. Comparing the relaxed surface with
the unrelaxed surface, it was found that the surface P and Ni
atoms move inward slightly, making them coplanar on the
surface. The change in the surface bonding conguration is
caused by minimization of the system energy.
Electronic characteristics of stable surfaces
To reveal the origin of HER activity of Ni3P, the Density of States
(DOS) of bulk Ni3P and the low-index surfaces are calculated as
shown in Fig. 3. In order to nd the change of the electronic
structure, the electronic structures of black P and bulk Ni are
also added and compared with that of Ni3P.
As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), we found that the carrier density of
Ni3P changes greatly when compared with black P and Ni metal.
The electrons of black P are not localized while the electrons of
bulk Ni3P are localized, indicating that the bond energy of Ni3P
is greatly increased compared to that of black P. Furthermore,
there are strong and broad peaks ranging from 5 to 2 eV for
metal Ni while the range and intensity of the peaks reduced
especially near the Fermi energy for bulk Ni3P, which indicates
that the free carrier density of Ni3P under the Fermi level is

 reduced.38 It can be observed from Fig. 3(b) that the DOS in the
region of 5 eV to 4 eV is greatly increased for all of those
surfaces when compared with bulk Ni3P. This is consistent with
the above geometric structure where surface P moves inward
and the bond energy increases. On the surfaces, the DOS near
the Fermi energy will slightly increase due to disappearance of

 the anti-bond, compared with bulk Ni3P. Based on Fig. S3,† the
main contributions for the Fermi energy are from Ni 3d, and
some from Ni 4p and P 3p. A signicant overlap of states from
8 eV to 5 eV is mainly due to the interaction between Ni 3d
and P 3p orbitals; the formation of Ni–P bonds produces a weak
ligand eﬀect by minor stabilization of the Ni 3d levels and

 a small Ni to P charge transfer.39 To better understand the
ability of diﬀerent surfaces for photocatalytic applications
towards water splitting, the positions of the Fermi energies of
diﬀerent facets are investigated by work function calculations as
indicated in Fig. S4.† Fig. 3(c) shows that the biggest potential
diﬀerence between the surfaces and the HER is only 0.18 V,
although the potentials for most surfaces are more negative
than that of the HER. This indicates that all of the surfaces are
suitable for the HER, especially the (100)B, (110)B and (111)D
surfaces based on Fermi energy consideration. As shown in
Fig. 3(d), the bridge of Ni–P is electron enriched and top Ni
easily loses electrons.
The surface activity for the HER
To understand the origin of the catalytic activity of diﬀerent
facets in the HER, DFT calculations of the Gibbs free energies of
hydrogen adsorption were carried out. As the adsorption free
energy of hydrogen (DGH) has been shown to be a good
descriptor of materials for catalyzing hydrogen generation
following either the Volmer–Tafel or the Heyrovsky mecha-
nism,40 DGH was used in this work to evaluate the catalytic
activity of catalysts for the HER. In principle, the catalytic
activity of a catalyst correlates with the DGH value, a smaller
DGH (absolute value) indicating better HER activity.41
Fig. 4 displays the calculated free energy diagram for
hydrogen evolution on diﬀerent active surface sites. As illus-
trated in Fig. 4(a), we found that free energies for hydrogen
evolution are 0.23 eV and 0.07 eV for Ni(111) and Pt(111)
surfaces, respectively, and this is largely consistent with
previous experimental and calculated results.42,43 Furthermore,
it is observed that the hollow Ni site is the most stable site for
adsorption of the H atom. However, most of those stable
adsorption sites are not catalytically active because it requires
a high energy for desorption of the adsorbed H* (bond-breaking
processes).44 Taking (001)B as an example, the most stable
adsorption positions are the hollow sites of Ni2Ni4Ni4 with an
adsorption energy of 0.54 eV. This is also consistent with
previous ndings, where the unsaturated species prefer the
bridge or hollow sites.45 The bridge Ni1Ni4, bridge Ni3Ni4, and
top P1 sites are able to trap protons and bond the atomic
hydrogen while still desorb H2 easily. This agrees well with the
results reported by Jin and coauthors.26 It is notable that the
stable adsorption site is also the active site for the (110)B facet
with a free energy of 0.07 eV. This is important for the HER.
When the active site is the stable site, H* will be supplied
continuously because it is the most energetically favorable to
adsorb the H atom for the active site. However, when the stable
adsorbed H* is not the active site as other surfaces, the H* will
be rstly adsorbed on the stable site and then on the active site.
The rst adsorbed H* may induce the charge redistribution and
then aﬀect the HER activity. Fig. 5 is a summary of the exchange
current for hydrogen evolution and density of active sites on
diﬀerent Ni3P surfaces.
As indicated in Fig. 5, the over-potentials on the (111)B, (110)
B and (110)C for the HER is 0.05 V, 0.07 V and 0.06 V, which are
even better than that of Pt(111). These three surfaces could be
the ideal surfaces for the HER. However, the largest number of
active sites is only 0.036 N ˚A2 on the (110)B and (110)C surfaces
under applied 100 mV over-potential. This is much small than
that of the Pt(111) surface (nearly 0.132 N ˚A2). Increasing the
active sites by doping or enlarging the specic surface area by
nanostructure formation could be a useful strategy to improve
the HER activity of Ni3P further.
Chemical stability of low-index surfaces
The resistance against chemical degradation is an important
consideration for the electrode material for electrochemical
catalytic reactions. Pourbaix diagrams can assess the stability

surfaces, double counting is to be avoided. Take the (001)B for example, both the hollow Ni2Ni4Ni4 site and bridge Ni2Ni4 site can absorb the H
atom; these two sites can only be counted once because they refer to the same atom.

 against decomposition into any combination of solids.46 We
have calculated the Pourbaix diagram of Ni–P and the Gibbs
energies for the corresponding decomposition process, as
shown in Fig. 6(a).
Thermodynamically, Ni3P is stable only in a small region
with pH values from 2 to 3 and at the narrow electrochemical
potential window below f(H+/H2). From the thermodynamic
perspective, Ni3P may transform into Ni(s) and Ni2+ with
chemical reactions R1–R5 in aqueous solutions. We choose
H2SO4, H2O, H2, and K2SO4 in the calculation as they are
commonly encountered environments by an HER electrode.
The DG for the above possible processes of Ni3P degradation is
shown in Fig. 6(b). As indicated in Fig. 6(b), the DG for the
decomposition of Ni3P is negative in the presence of O2 while
positive without the presence of O2 for these selected degrada-
tion processes. Therefore, Ni3P can be thermodynamically
stable in solutions without the presence of O2. However, in the
presence of O2, Ni3P has a tendency to corrode. Besides the
thermodynamic consideration, the stability of Ni3P in a prac-
tical situation also depends on the kinetic process, because any
reaction would require additional energy for structural rear-
rangement. Based on the above analysis, we conrm that Ni3P
can be stable without strongly oxidative conditions in typical
HER solutions. Therefore, Ni3P can only be used as a cathode
material for water splitting (as the anode surface will generate
reactive oxygen species). In an experimental setup, it is neces-
sary to reduce the O2 concentration in the solution. To verify our
prediction, an experiment was carried out where owing O2 gas
through the solution reduced the current density quickly while
owing Ar increased the current density gradually (in ESI,
Fig. S13†).
Conclusions
In this paper, a comprehensive theoretical analysis was carried
out on the geometric structure, electronic characteristics, HER
activity and stability of diﬀerent Ni3P surfaces with diﬀerent
terminations. The results indicate that P-rich and some stoi-
chiometric surfaces are thermodynamically stable. Eight such
stable low-index surfaces with diﬀerent surface terminations
were then selected to investigate their electronic characteristics
and catalytic activity. It is demonstrated that most of the stable
adsorption sites are not catalytically active because a high
energy is required for desorption of the adsorbed H*. Among
the stable low-index surfaces, the (110)B has a low over-
potential and more active site density for the HER by electro-
chemical catalysis. The (110)B surface is also the most stable
surface which should be easily synthesized in the experiment. It
is hereby shown that the (110)B surface in Ni3P is indispensable
for the HER, because of its good electrocatalytic activity, suit-
able potential, and high stability. Although the over-potential of
(110)B is close to that of Pt, the number of active sites for (110)B
is only 27% of the one on Pt(111). Increasing the active sites
through doping or enlarging the surface area by nanostructure
formation could be a useful strategy to improve the HER activity
of Ni3P further. Furthermore, Ni3P needs more energy in its
decomposition process without O2 although it is thermody-
namically unstable in most aqueous solutions according to the
Pourbaix diagram. O2 was found unfavorable for the stability of
Ni3P. Thus, it is necessary to reduce O2 during the electro-
chemical catalysis process. Our study has provided insights into
the properties of Ni3P facets. The obtained understandings are
useful for the design and fabrication of cathode materials for
solar energy conversion devices.

 Computational methods
The CASTEP module of Materials Studio soware (Accelrys Inc.)
was employed for the quantum chemistry calculations. The
surfaces were obtained from the optimized Ni3P (space group
82) with a vacuum region of 15 ˚A. During the calculations, self-
consistent periodic DFT was adopted to explore the electronic
structure and catalytic activities on the facets. Ionic cores were
represented by an ultrasopseudopotential. Perdew–Burke–

method
to
calculate
the
exchange–correlation energy. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–
Shanno (BFGS) scheme was selected as the minimization algo-
rithm. DFT-D correction was used for dispersion corrections.
The energy cutoﬀis 380 eV and the SCF tolerance is 1.0 
106 eV per atom. The optimization is completed when the
energy, maximum force, maximum stress and maximum
displacement are smaller than 5.0  106 eV per atom, 0.01 eV
˚A1, 0.02 GPa and 5.0  104 ˚A, respectively.47 The k-point
samplings were set as 2  2  3 for the bulk and 2  2  1 for
surfaces during the calculations because there is no signicant
change in the calculated energies for a larger k-point mesh.
Furthermore, at least ve P layers were selected to reduce the
dispersive error (see Fig. S14†). Considering the symmetry of the
(001), (100), (110), (101) and (111) surfaces with diﬀerent
terminations, 19 surfaces were chosen for the calculation (see
ESI, Fig. S1 and S15†). The calculated crystallographic param-
eters are in good agreement with experimental data, as listed in
Table S10.† Table S11† shows the calculated energies of related
species during calculation. The surface energy can be calculated
using eqn (1). The formation energies for Ni3P are indicated as
eqn (2):
When adding eqn (2) and eqn (1), we can obtain the surface
energy as eqn (3), where Eslab is the total energy of the slab
model, Ebulk Ni and Ebulk P are the total energy per atom of the
metal Ni fcc and black P, nNi and nP are the number of atoms
that the slab model contains, and A is the surface area of the
slab model. The free energy of the adsorption atomic hydrogen
is obtained using eqn (4), where DEZPE denotes the zero-point
energy of the system and is simplied as 0.05 eV. The term
TDSH is the contribution from entropy at temperature K and is
0.20 eV at 298 K.48 DEH describes the energy needed to increase
the coverage by one hydrogen atom, which is calculated as eqn
(5), where E[Ni3P + H] is the total energy of the system, including
the adsorbed molecules and the Ni3P facet; E[Ni3P] is the energy
of the Ni3P facet; E(H2) represents the total energy of a gas phase
H2 molecule. The exchange current at pH 0 can be calculated
using eqn (6) and (7),42 where k0 is the rate constant, and equal
to 200 s per site; k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the
temperature, set at 298 K in the current work.
