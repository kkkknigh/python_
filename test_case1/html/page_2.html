    <p>studies, most researchers only paid attention to the stoichiometric surface to understand the surface properties and reaction mechanism.<sup class="reference">33</sup> The non-stoichiometric surface could be more stable in most cases, and could truly represent the reality.<sup class="reference">34</sup> Therefore, attention should also be paid to non-stoichiometric surfaces during theoretical studies.</p>

    <p>In this work, we report a comprehensive theoretical study of Ni<sub>3</sub>P, including its geometric structure, electronic characteristics, HER activity and stability for different surface orientations and terminations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our current study provides an improved understanding of this material and insights into its electro-catalytic ability for the HER. The outcome also helps in the design and selection of electrocatalysts in the experiment.</p>

    <h2>Results and discussion</h2>
    <h3>Surface energies for different ordinations and terminations</h3>
    <p>Surface energy is an important parameter that affects the stability and catalytic activity. Fig. 1 shows the surface energies of stable surfaces with different terminations.</p>

    <p>At first, the allowed ranges of chemical potentials (Δμ<sub>P</sub>, Δμ<sub>Ni</sub>) were determined from the formation energy of different structures. The results of Fig. 1(a) are consistent with previous experiments and calculations.<sup class="reference">35-37</sup> We find that Ni<sub>3</sub>P is stable at −1.78 eV < Δμ<sub>P</sub> < −1.18 eV. When Δμ<sub>P</sub> is smaller than −1.78 eV, bulk Ni becomes thermodynamically favorable, while Ni<sub>12</sub>P<sub>5</sub> becomes favorable when Δμ<sub>P</sub> is larger than −1.18 eV. Considering the temperature effect and interface reorganization contributions, the Δμ<sub>P</sub> was enlarged from −1.88 eV to −1.08 eV during the surface energy calculation. Fig. 1(b) demonstrates the stable terminations for different low-index surfaces. It indicates that Ni-rich surfaces are not stable in all low-index surfaces as there is no line with a slope greater than zero. For the (001) and (011) surfaces, the P-rich surfaces are stable in the whole region of Δμ<sub>P</sub>. For the (110) and (111) surfaces, the P-rich surfaces are stable in a large region especially in the P-rich environment (Δμ<sub>P</sub> around −1.18 eV), while stoichiometric surfaces become stable in the Ni-rich environment (Δμ<sub>P</sub> around −1.78 eV). For the (100) surface, stoichiometric surfaces are stable in a large region. Furthermore, the (110) surface has the lowest surface energy. Based on the surface energies, the above eight surfaces with the lowest energies were selected to investigate the electronic characteristics and catalytic activity.</p>

    <h3>Geometric structure of stable surfaces</h3>
    <p>The optimized geometric structures of eight stable surfaces are shown in Fig. 2.</p>

    <p>Fig. 2 displays the top and side views of stable surfaces with different terminations. Among these surfaces, the (100)B, (110)C and (111)D are the stoichiometric surfaces while others are P-rich surfaces. In all surfaces, the surface Ni and P atoms are coplanar in a relaxed slab. Comparing the relaxed surface with the unrelaxed surface, it was found that the surface P and Ni atoms move inward slightly, making them coplanar on the surface. The change in the surface bonding configuration is caused by minimization of the system energy.</p>

    <h3>Electronic characteristics of stable surfaces</h3>
    <p>To reveal the origin of HER activity of Ni<sub>3</sub>P, the Density of States (DOS) of bulk Ni<sub>3</sub>P and the low-index surfaces are calculated as shown in Fig. 3. In order to find the change of the electronic structure, the electronic structures of black P and bulk Ni are also added and compared with that of Ni<sub>3</sub>P.</p>

    <p>As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), we found that the carrier density of Ni<sub>3</sub>P changes greatly when compared with black P and Ni metal. The electrons of black P are not localized while the electrons of bulk Ni<sub>3</sub>P are localized, indicating that the bond energy of Ni<sub>3</sub>P is greatly increased compared to that of black P. Furthermore, there are strong and broad peaks ranging from −5 to 2 eV for metal Ni while the range and intensity of the peaks reduced especially near the Fermi energy for bulk Ni<sub>3</sub>P, which indicates that the free carrier density of Ni<sub>3</sub>P under the Fermi level is</p>

The regions of thermodynamic stability for Ni<sub>x</sub>P<sub>y</sub> are indicated with color. (b) The surface energies of stable surfaces with different terminations.
