    <p>reduced.<sup class="reference">38</sup> It can be observed from Fig. 3(b) that the DOS in the region of −5 eV to −4 eV is greatly increased for all of those surfaces when compared with bulk Ni<sub>3</sub>P. This is consistent with the above geometric structure where surface P moves inward and the bond energy increases. On the surfaces, the DOS near the Fermi energy will slightly increase due to disappearance of</p>

        The optimized geometric structures of eight stable surfaces, where surface vectors are also indicated. The atoms in the first layer of the surface are shown in big spheres, those in the second layer of the surface are shown in medium-sized spheres and the others are shown in small spheres. Violet spheres stand for P atoms and blue spheres stand for Ni atoms. B.O. stands for the geometric structure before optimization while A.O. stands for the geometric structure after optimization. d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> stand for the distance of the two atoms as labeled.
