    <p>a small Ni to P charge transfer.<sup class="reference">39</sup> To better understand the ability of different surfaces for photocatalytic applications towards water splitting, the positions of the Fermi energies of different facets are investigated by work function calculations as indicated in Fig. S4.† Fig. 3(c) shows that the biggest potential difference between the surfaces and the HER is only 0.18 V, although the potentials for most surfaces are more negative than that of the HER. This indicates that all of the surfaces are suitable for the HER, especially the (100)B, (110)B and (111)D surfaces based on Fermi energy consideration. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the bridge of Ni–P is electron enriched and top Ni easily loses electrons.</p>

    <h3>The surface activity for the HER</h3>
    <p>To understand the origin of the catalytic activity of different facets in the HER, DFT calculations of the Gibbs free energies of hydrogen adsorption were carried out. As the adsorption free energy of hydrogen (ΔG<sub>H</sub>) has been shown to be a good descriptor of materials for catalyzing hydrogen generation following either the Volmer–Tafel or the Heyrovsky mechanism,<sup class="reference">40</sup> ΔG<sub>H</sub> was used in this work to evaluate the catalytic activity of catalysts for the HER. In principle, the catalytic activity of a catalyst correlates with the ΔG<sub>H</sub> value, a smaller ΔG<sub>H</sub> (absolute value) indicating better HER activity.<sup class="reference">41</sup></p>

    <p>Fig. 4 displays the calculated free energy diagram for hydrogen evolution on different active surface sites. As illustrated in Fig. 4(a), we found that free energies for hydrogen evolution are −0.23 eV and −0.07 eV for Ni(111) and Pt(111) surfaces, respectively, and this is largely consistent with previous experimental and calculated results.<sup class="reference">42,43</sup> Furthermore, it is observed that the hollow Ni site is the most stable site for adsorption of the H atom. However, most of those stable adsorption sites are not catalytically active because it requires a high energy for desorption of the adsorbed H* (bond-breaking processes).<sup class="reference">44</sup> Taking (001)B as an example, the most stable adsorption positions are the hollow sites of Ni<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub> with an adsorption energy of −0.54 eV. This is also consistent with previous findings, where the unsaturated species prefer the bridge or hollow sites.<sup class="reference">45</sup> The bridge Ni<sub>1</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub>, bridge Ni<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub>, and top P<sub>1</sub> sites are able to trap protons and bond the atomic hydrogen while still desorb H<sub>2</sub> easily. This agrees well with the results reported by Jin and coauthors.<sup class="reference">26</sup> It is notable that the stable adsorption site is also the active site for the (110)B facet with a free energy of 0.07 eV. This is important for the HER. When the active site is the stable site, H* will be supplied continuously because it is the most energetically favorable to adsorb the H atom for the active site. However, when the stable adsorbed H* is not the active site as other surfaces, the H* will be firstly adsorbed on the stable site and then on the active site. The firstly adsorbed H* may induce the charge redistribution and then affect the HER activity. Fig. 5 is a summary of the exchange current for hydrogen evolution and density of active sites on different Ni<sub>3</sub>P surfaces.</p>

    <p>As indicated in Fig. 5, the over-potentials on the (111)B, (110)B and (110)C for the HER is 0.05 V, 0.07 V and 0.06 V, which are even better than that of Pt(111). These three surfaces could be the ideal surfaces for the HER. However, the largest number of active sites is only 0.036 N Å<sup>−2</sup> on the (110)B and (110)C surfaces under applied 100 mV over-potential. This is much small than that of the Pt(111) surface (nearly 0.132 N Å<sup>−2</sup>). Increasing the active sites by doping or enlarging the specific surface area by nanostructure formation could be a useful strategy to improve the HER activity of Ni<sub>3</sub>P further.</p>

    <h3>Chemical stability of low-index surfaces</h3>
    <p>The resistance against chemical degradation is an important consideration for the electrode material for electrochemical catalytic reactions. Pourbaix diagrams can assess the stability</p>

        (a) The exchange current for hydrogen evolution over different Ni<sub>3</sub>P surfaces, Pt(111) and Ni(111) plotted as a function of the calculated hydrogen chemisorption energy. The experimental data for Ni and Pt from ref. 44 are also added; (b) the number of active sites on different surfaces, double counting is to be avoided. Take the (001)B for example, both the hollow Ni<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub> site and bridge Ni<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub> site can absorb the H atom; these two sites can only be counted once because they refer to the same atom.
