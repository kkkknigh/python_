    <p>against decomposition into any combination of solids.<sup class="reference">46</sup> We have calculated the Pourbaix diagram of Ni–P and the Gibbs energies for the corresponding decomposition process, as shown in Fig. 6(a).</p>

    <p>Thermodynamically, Ni<sub>3</sub>P is stable only in a small region with pH values from −2 to 3 and at the narrow electrochemical potential window below f(H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>). From the thermodynamic perspective, Ni<sub>3</sub>P may transform into Ni(s) and Ni<sup>2+</sup> with chemical reactions R1–R5 in aqueous solutions. We choose H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>, and K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in the calculation as they are commonly encountered environments by an HER electrode. The ΔG for the above possible processes of Ni<sub>3</sub>P degradation is shown in Fig. 6(b). As indicated in Fig. 6(b), the ΔG for the decomposition of Ni<sub>3</sub>P is negative in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> while positive without the presence of O<sub>2</sub> for these selected degradation processes. Therefore, Ni<sub>3</sub>P can be thermodynamically stable in solutions without the presence of O<sub>2</sub>. However, in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, Ni<sub>3</sub>P has a tendency to corrode. Besides the thermodynamic consideration, the stability of Ni<sub>3</sub>P in a practical situation also depends on the kinetic process, because any reaction would require additional energy for structural rearrangement. Based on the above analysis, we confirm that Ni<sub>3</sub>P can be stable without strongly oxidative conditions in typical HER solutions. Therefore, Ni<sub>3</sub>P can only be used as a cathode material for water splitting (as the anode surface will generate reactive oxygen species). In an experimental setup, it is necessary to reduce the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the solution. To verify our prediction, an experiment was carried out where flowing O<sub>2</sub> gas through the solution reduced the current density quickly while flowing Ar increased the current density gradually (in ESI, Fig. S13†).</p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>In this paper, a comprehensive theoretical analysis was carried out on the geometric structure, electronic characteristics, HER activity and stability of different Ni<sub>3</sub>P surfaces with different terminations. The results indicate that P-rich and some stoichiometric surfaces are thermodynamically stable. Eight such stable low-index surfaces with different surface terminations were then selected to investigate their electronic characteristics and catalytic activity. It is demonstrated that most of the stable adsorption sites are not catalytically active because a high energy is required for desorption of the adsorbed H*. Among the stable low-index surfaces, the (110)B has a low over-potential and more active site density for the HER by electrochemical catalysis. The (110)B surface is also the most stable surface which should be easily synthesized in the experiment. It is hereby shown that the (110)B surface in Ni<sub>3</sub>P is indispensable for the HER, because of its good electrocatalytic activity, suitable potential, and high stability. Although the over-potential of (110)B is close to that of Pt, the number of active sites for (110)B is only 27% of the one on Pt(111). Increasing the active sites through doping or enlarging the surface area by nanostructure formation could be a useful strategy to improve the HER activity of Ni<sub>3</sub>P further. Furthermore, Ni<sub>3</sub>P needs more energy in its decomposition process without O<sub>2</sub> although it is thermodynamically unstable in most aqueous solutions according to the Pourbaix diagram. O<sub>2</sub> was found unfavorable for the stability of Ni<sub>3</sub>P. Thus, it is necessary to reduce O<sub>2</sub> during the electrochemical catalysis process. Our study has provided insights into the properties of Ni<sub>3</sub>P facets. The obtained understandings are useful for the design and fabrication of cathode materials for solar energy conversion devices.</p>
